// What a completed sample's rungs found against its first read, closed, by
// the facts of the series and never by a share of them. A sample is classed
// by what its data settled to: the read of its last change, which a later
// rung read again the same. A change that came back, or a series that came
// and went, is not one.
//
//   - window_read_early: the first read was empty and data came later, or a
//     series the first read had came back with other points or values, or
//     not at all. The whole window was read before its data was complete;
//     the strategy's time_delay is what moves the read, and a value revised
//     after it was judged is evidence for that and is not judged again.
//   - partial_revised: some series the first read had came back with other
//     points or values and a value there, and others with a value came back
//     as they were -- a series quiet in both is neither: the
//     first read had those whole. Not the window read early -- the Query
//     Group's read is not what was late -- and not series_late -- the series
//     were there, so a supplement of new series does not reach them. Counted
//     apart from the first version on; the time_delay run treats it as it
//     treats window_read_early, as it did before the two were told apart.
//   - series_late: every series the first read had came back as it was, and
//     series it did not have came later: some series are late, which is the
//     supplementary detection's to fill.
//   - complete: what the data settled to is what the first read had.
//   - unclassified: which of these it is is not known, counted by why
//     (UnclassifiedReasons) and not a fault. memory_refused: a rung differed
//     and its series could not be compared, one side's table having been
//     refused by the memory line, and no other rung's series said which it
//     was. unsettled: the deepest rung still changed, so no later read says
//     the data had settled; a value still moving then is late data or a
//     source that revises, and one read cannot tell them apart.
