// Every number there counts objects. An object is one of this deployment's own
// identities: it cannot be looked up, cannot be mentioned to whoever configured
// the strategy, and a count of them does not say whether this is one
// misconfiguration or fifty. So a reader could see HEALTHY beside 58 demoted and
// 18 undecidable objects and still not know which alerts are not being raised,
// which ones can be raised but will never clear, how many businesses that
// touches, or whether any of it needs doing something about today.
//
// "alarmd 自己健康" and "告警业务正常" are different claims and the page was
// making only the first while reading as though it made both. Conforming to the
// design and being a business risk are not exclusive.
//
// So the verdict travels with the same population counted in the unit the work
// is actually done in: strategies, and the businesses they belong to.

// ColumnImpact is one column expressed as strategies and businesses.
