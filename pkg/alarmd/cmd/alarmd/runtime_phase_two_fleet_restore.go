// progressRestoreSource reads what the control plane already recorded about
// objects, so a replica that just started does not have to watch a fresh
// round before it can say anything.
//
// It reads the same Progress the scheduler reads, in one batched read, and
// only for objects this replica owns and either has not yet determined or has
// determined without ever seeing records (fleet.Tracker.WantsRestore). The
// publisher bounds how many it asks for per tick, and each record is admitted
// by the observation memory line before it is read: the answer covers the
// ones admitted, in order, and the rest are the next publish's. A record the
// line keeps refusing -- room that stays above zero and below that record's
// length -- holds the objects after it back as long as it lasts, and is seen
// as fleet_restore refusals that keep rising. An object
// whose record is missing restores nothing and is not an error; one whose
// record could not be read or decoded is an error of its own, in its place.
//
// Only a record read and found unusable -- it did not decode, named another
// object, or decoded and did not validate -- is a fact about that record.
// Redis answering its key with an error (LOADING while it loads a dataset,
// BUSY behind a script) or the read not reaching Redis says nothing about
// it, and comes back as errRestoreUnread: the publisher spends no attempt
// on it and reads it again at the next publish.

// fleetRestoreBudgetPerPublish is how many objects one publish may ask to

// its length (progressRestoreSource).
//
// It is a rate, not a cap: every owned object is eventually restored, just
// spread across publishes rather than read in one burst at the moment the
// process is least settled.
//
// What it guards is the publish itself. restoreOwned runs inline before the
// snapshot is built, and its read is two round trips -- the records' lengths,
// then the records the line admitted -- and a restarting replica's reads on
// the control-plane store to this many per interval. The bytes are the
// line's to bound: a record is typically about a kilobyte, so a batch is
// about half a megabyte, but one carrying an unfinished range may be a
// megabyte, and a batch of those is read as far as the line has room.
//
// What it costs is time to a complete view after a start: ceil(wanted/512)
// publishes while the line has room, wanted being the owned objects not yet
// determined plus those determined without records (fleet.Tracker.WantsRestore).
// At the default 5 s interval that is one or two publishes for the 700 to 900
// a replica wants on the deployments this has run on, and about three minutes
// for 20,000, within RestartCatchUpGrace; slower when the line refuses. A
// record-at-a-time read of 128 per publish took about 13 minutes for the same
// 20,000.
