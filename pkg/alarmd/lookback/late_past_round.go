// A supplemented window's late series come to one of three things, and each
// has its own remedy.
//
// Every late series had crossed its Slot (crossed_t: the series' State was at
// the Slot or past it when the supplement came): the supplement recovered
// none, because the data arrives after the next round has already been
// judged. Only a longer time_delay reads it -- the strategy's to change, the
// same as a window read early. Two such windows in a row report it, and a
// window the supplement admitted anything in, or one with nothing late, ends
// it: the rule a window read early is reported and cleared by, with no
// proportion of its own. Every series means every one: a window some of
// whose series were withheld, read incomplete, drifted in configuration or
// recorded absent was not late alone, and a longer time_delay is not what it
// asks for. With nothing admitted it neither adds to the run nor ends it.
//
// Some series were admitted and some had crossed: the supplement is doing its
// work, and a longer time_delay would slow the whole Query Group for a few
// series that are later still. Those few are a residual miss, counted with
// the latest windows as evidence, and the data's to look at.
//
// None had crossed: the supplement recovered everything late.
//
// Both reports stand while the Query Group is read directed (seriesLateState)
// and go, with what they were counted from, when its series are late no
// more: a Query Group read directed again starts both afresh, from windows
// opened since.

// LatePastRoundSample is one supplemented window every late series of which
// had crossed its Slot: the Slot, the rung its late series were read at and
// how long after the Slot's first read that was, how many series the first
// read had and how many the read at the rung found late -- series, each
// once -- and how many (Plan, series) pairs had crossed: a series of a
// query several Plans share is a pair of each.
