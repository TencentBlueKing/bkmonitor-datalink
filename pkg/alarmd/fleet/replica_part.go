// ReplicaPart is one replica's share of the numbers the first screen draws
// from rows, in the shape that adds across replicas: counts add, sets take
// their union, and a moment keeps the earliest. The part of a view of one
// replica's snapshot, merged with the others', gives the numbers the whole
// view gives -- which is what lets a replica publish its part and the leader
// read parts instead of every row (fleet-read-scale-design §6).
//
// A duration is never kept, only the moment it runs from: the reader turns
// it into a duration at its own time, so a part read later reads older.
// What is decided against the clock -- a pooled object being due, a record
// being recent -- is decided at the replica's own now, so a part is read at
// most a publish interval late.
//
// The merge equals the whole view while no object is held by two replicas.
// During a handover one is, for the moment of the handover: the whole view
// keeps one record of the object's skips where each replica's part counts its
// own, so the parts count it twice -- and a skip the old owner records while
// the new owner has already pooled the object reads, on the old owner's part,
// as a loss in progress where the whole view reads it as the pool's
// consequence. It is the moment compareCoverage reports the object as held by
// several, and the first screen says so beside the counts it reads from the
// parts (held_by_several_total) rather than going back to the whole view,
// which is the read this exists to stop.
//
// A replica publishes its part beside its snapshot (ReplicaSummary), with
// the fields the health route and the verdict scrape read. CheckRows and
// TodoRows are not published yet: the routes that draw the check lines and
// the to-do still read rows, and a part read back has neither -- the scrape
// reads the lines' counts from Metrics.
